## *Description*    
### *As of now the plan is to utilize Google Maps API to create a web application where users can input the name of a US city or zip code, indicate whether they plan to move to said city or just visit, and then receive relevant information. Ex; vacationing to a city would give you points of interest, popular tourist destinations, and possibly upcoming events. Moving to the city would give statistics like job growth, crime rate, median house cost etc.*
